# Trafic-Sign-Benchmark-Image-Classification

In this repo we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. 
With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
Our model got a 99% accuracy on the training dataset and 97% on the test dataset.
